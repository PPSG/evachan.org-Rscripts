## Handy R functions for genetics research 

Originally hosted at http://evachan.org/rscripts.html, these R functions were primarily written for my own research. However, (I'd like to think) I've written them to be generic enough to be useful to others. 

Please drop me an email if you spot a bug or have ideas for improvement.
